  Given I am logged in as "shopOwner"
  And I visit the "mainPage" page

Scenario: View some example shop admin statistics and items list
  When I click the "shopDashboardButton" element
  Then the "shopDashboard" page is displayed
  And there are following elements in table "stats":
   | active   | scheduled | paused    | completed      | cancelled      |
   | r:number | r:number  | r:number  | r:percentValue | r:percentValue |
  And there are "at least 1" following elements for element "shopItemList":
   | name     | f:isClickable   |
   | amount   | f:isVisible     |
   | price    | r:date          |
   | vat      | r:status        |
   | discount | r:number        |

Scenario: I want to add new product to shop
  When I click the "addNewProduct" element
  Then the "addNewProduct" page is displayed
  When I fill the form "newProductForm" with:
    | name     | exampleName     |
